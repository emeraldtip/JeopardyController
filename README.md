# ScuffedCuller
A terribly simple image culling software.

- Supports png and jpg (couldn't be bothered to implement raw support)
- Uh copies images into a subfolder called "culled"
- Gui is pretty garbage atm, had to rush this for reasons

Made as a learning project to learn [eepp](https://github.com/SpartanJ/eepp)
